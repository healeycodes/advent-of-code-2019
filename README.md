## Advent of Code 2019

ðŸŽ…

I'm using this year's event to try out different languages :)

I'm not shooting for super optimized solutions. As long as they finish in under one second, I'm happy.

<br>

Puzzles take their input as an arg in the format `<puzzle> <input>` e.g. `ruby ./part_two.rb ./input.txt`

<br>

Languages used so far:

1 - Python

2 - JavaScript

3 - Go

4 - PHP

5 - Lua

6 - Julia

8 - Ruby
