## Advent of Code 2019

ðŸŽ…

I'm aiming to use a different programming language for each day.

I'm not shooting for super optimized solutions. As long as they finish in under one second, I'm happy.

Languages used so far: Python, JavaScript, Go, PHP, Lua, Julia, Ruby

Puzzles can be run in the format `<puzzle> <input>` e.g. `ruby ./part_two.rb ./input.txt`
